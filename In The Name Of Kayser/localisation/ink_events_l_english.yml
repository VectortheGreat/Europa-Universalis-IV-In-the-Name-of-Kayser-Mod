 inkinfo.2_desc:0 "In order to become a Christian, you must first own Constantinople. When you own Constantinople, an event will trigger and offer 4 religion options. You can form 3 different states. Nova Imperium Romanum (Orthodox), the continuation of Byzantium, Imperium Turcicum (Catholic), the Turkish Empire under Latin influence, and The Eastern Knights (Coptic or Nestorian), which could evolve into Templars."

Fighting in the civil war (this will make you tired seriously) or leaving Anatolia (a new Muslim state will form in Anatolia). Leaving Anatolia is an option for amateur players and you can get cores from the provinces you lost from missions. The civil war is really hard. Never underestimate it. You have to get more loans, mercenaries and ally some strong countries for the civil war. You'll not lose provinces if you go to the civil war."
 inkinfo.4_title:0 "About Nova Imperium Romanum"
 inkinfo.4_desc:0 "In order to establish this state, Byzantium must not exist and you must be orthodox. While creating this state, I was inspired by the Eastern Roman Empire. The purpose of this state is to re-establish the Roman Empire. It is strong in administration. The number of content is less than in other states, but it has the best quality and most powerful content. Its contents:\n§GNearly 52 missions, 24 events, 30 Government reforms, 4 age bonuses, 1 estate privilege and the most powerful ideas.§!"
 inkinfo.5_title:0 "About Imperium Turcicum"
 inkinfo.5_desc:0 "You have to be Catholic to establish this state. It will be a Latin-influenced state. The greatest powers of this state are diplomacy, colony and mercenaries. But this state does not only have a catholic scenario. There are 5 reform paths. When Protestantism is triggered, reform troubles will begin. This sub-scenario is Catholic / Protestant / Reformed / Hussite / Anglican / Phaedrusian(new eastern reformed religion). Whichever path you choose, 5 new special missions will be added. Its contents:\n§G73 missions, 81 events, 30 government reforms, 4 age bonuses, 3 estate privileges and 5 special mercenary companies.§!"

 inkinfo.6_desc:0 "You must be Coptic or Nestorian to establish this state. The beginning is more difficult than the others. The purpose of this state is to spread Christianity to the east.

 inkinfo.7_desc:0 "It is the easiest country to start within this mod. Since the Balkans is Orthodox, the civil war is less troubling. If you have Third Rome DLC you can get Icon of Eleusa for easy Civil War. Turkish Civil War mission will give core in Athens, Trebizond, Arta and Cephalonia. That's why you can choose to take Trebizond, Athens and Epirus as vassals. Try to expand by following the missions. You can form Neo Eastern Roman Culture Group."
 inkinfo.8_title:0 "Imperium Turcicum Tips"
 inkinfo.8_desc:0 "If you complete early missions, the beginning will be easy. At the beginning of the game, improve the relationship with the Papal State and try to be an ally with them. This will allow you to complete 3 missions and will make the civil war even easier. When Protestant is enabled, reform troubles will begin in your country. You can stay Catholic if you want, or you can go through 5 alternative reform paths. Also you can form Neo Balkan Anatolian Culture Group."
 inkinfo.9_title:0 "The Eastern Knights Tips"
 inkinfo.9_desc:0 "The beginning is the hardest. Start by converting the Balkans and you will earn 2 missionaries when you complete the missions. After ending the civil war, complete the missions to Convert Anatolia and Convert the Balkans and then declare war against the Papal State. You will be able to activate the crusade mechanic when you are at war with the Papal State in its mission(Check it before war). In this state, there is a subject type named Crusader March. These marches can only be established by missions and annexed by decisions. It is half-independent. The regions they are in belong only to them. Also you can form Neo Turkic Culture Group."
